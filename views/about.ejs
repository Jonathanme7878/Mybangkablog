            Hello there! 👋 Welcome to my blog. My name is Jojo and I am the
            “Boy”. As the name of this blog might have suggested, I love food
            and travelling, and one of my biggest motivation for traveling the
            world is to taste even more food!

            With traveling, you can reduce stress, keep your body fit, expand
            your knowledge, improve your social skills, make new friends, test
            your leadership qualities and flexibility, cultivate a more grateful
            attitude, and much more.
          </p>

            The vastness of the world, especially in Indonesia, which has more
            than 17 thousand islands, is very tempting to explore. Adventurous
            souls seem eager to satisfy their 'wanderlust' or 'travel bug'
            cravings – the urge to keep exploring.
          </p>
          <p class="text-home">
            So, traveling is not just about spending money recklessly. Of
            course, provided that everything is done with careful consideration
            and not driven solely by impulse.

            Everything you see here on this blog is done by yours truly.
