          be seen that this beach must have certain uniqueness. Indeed, on this
          beach there is a large granite stone, which stands upright on other

          Batu Dinding Beach area is not extensive only around the giant stones.
          Meanwhile, there is a hill directly facing the sea. Unlike most
          beaches in Indonesia Batu Dinding is not a white sandy beach due to
          the contours of the coast which is rocky and steep. In fact, the main
          attraction is the giant rock that resembles a wall. Visitors can not
          swim or bathe because the water under is muddy. Visitors often climb
          to the base of the giant stone, but you can not climb to the top
          because of its position which is perpendicular and no stepping place
          whatsoever.
